I ran into a problem pushing the image to dockerhub
because I was using docker instead of podman. It
turned out I had to tag the image before pushing it.

As far as I know everything should be working now.
If not I must have misunderstood something.



My docker image:

Find a way to inspect the database tables being created and attach a screenshot of the database schema to your report. Do the created tables correspond to your initial thoughts regarding the exercise?

In particular, you should write about:

* technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved

* a link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!

* an explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created. For the latter, you may provide screenshots.

* any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve
