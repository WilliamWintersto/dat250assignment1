# Lab1 report
There were no problems with the installation part.

I followed every step of the tutorial and did not
run into any problems that would indicate the
development environment is not working correctly.

I ran into a problem pushing the image to dockerhub
because I was using docker instead of podman. It
turned out I had to tag the image before pushing it.

As far as I know everything should be working now.
If not I must have misunderstood something.



My docker image:
