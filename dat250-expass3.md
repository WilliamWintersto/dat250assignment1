# Lab3 report


### Problems
One problem i had was when trying to validate the installation package was that the given scipt had a different version number. This caused an error when trying to validate, but was easily fixed my changing the version number in all locations.


### Experiment 1
Some of the script outputs were way longer than others so I ended up choosing the shorter ones.
